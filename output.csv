Jumbo Visma always adding new talent !
😂😂😂😂 I enjoy that one❤
"Historical. Just couple of weeks ago Jonas stated he doesn't follow social media. About Tadej etc. Now he is in the paid advertisment, lol 😮😂"
This is pretty cheeky.  😅 I like it.
Up the Jumbo Visma boys 🌕🌑🌕
"I'm Jonas' fan I found out as the winner of the cycle.  I like cool looks and especially smiley wrinkles around your mouth. I practice every day to resemble your smile. Moreover, the voice is wonderful.  Your children are lucky. I'll be rooting for you to win the Tour de France in 2023"
I like the whole idea. But the director is shockingly awful.
That’s a funny video
Smart move. Olav has a lot of potential.
Send him to grand tour..don’t make us and Olav disappointed 😊
Lol that made no sense but still nice to see some humour from TJV!

This is a great video! Congratulations to Olav and TJV. 🎉🎉
"Great news!  Well played, Team Jumbo Visma! 😂👍💯"
"badly acted, delivering great news"
