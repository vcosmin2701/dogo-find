Jumbo Visma team has f~~king Gladiators that shows no mercy😂 my favorite team❤
"Focusing positive energy, eating well and maximising marginal gains. Go Jonas! I believe in miracles."
"""So, what did you guys do on the rest day then?""
""Jonas Vingegaard believes in the team's plan.""
""Eh, you hit your head or something?""
""Please, call an ambulance..."""
Jonas in the days off is resting while Pogačar doing backflips in the pool 😂
wish good luck today to Jonas and Jumbo.
#freeWout
I hope wout transfers to another team
"Good luck tomorrow with the TT Jonas and apart from Wout, suspect the rest of the team will be taking it easy so are refreshed and ready to ride hard in support of Jonas on Wednesday - go Jumba!!"
Wout and Kuss are fucking champions
This video could have easily been at least 5 minutes long.
"Your fans are with you, but you can put out a better video than this. Atleast have the title & video representing eachother."
Idiots wearing facemasks outside. I thought this nonsense was over.
Ok. So Jonas is dreaming about victory... But what are the other riders doing?
Saw them whoosh by on the rest day ride today. Nearly had a heart attack 🤣
Laughing my ass off to the title and video.
Jonas and his mask its ridiculous.
Crush the Pog! 💕🚴
Best team in world 🎉
So basically the riders spend the rest day believing. Nice.
What does the title have to do with the actual video?
Wout is probably going up Mont Blanc again
to be fair i have no idea how your riders spent the rest day after this video lol
"Jonas is in a 'super 'doper'' shape, and he believes in his 'shape'.
Jonas also believes in Dopo Visma.
Wish you all the dopest moments till Paris."
Who's the super tall dude walking behind Jonas at 0:16?
"My one 1 team @ the TDF & always. Go guys (Jonas) The Victory is yours. Sending you all the prayers, love and support from here in kampala Uganda 🇺🇬  Africa."
I got the dream!
