"Jumbo-Visma fell asleep at most crucial time , plane and simple...!"
I wonder why Wout did not get any support in the fast few min? Even Vingegaard could have helped in pulling for a minute or two? What do you think why a Team like Jumbo Visma cannot do help Wout in the last few mins? Is it a tacical mistake?
