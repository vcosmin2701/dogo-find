"Van Aert is the best rider in that team, better than Roglic, better than Bingeggard, the team has to give him the leadership role in a big competition and we will see the real monster that he is"
"So, we all acting like the rider who broke the story about wout leaving early was denigrated and deserves an apology from Wout and Jumbo Visma? Where's the apology you assholes."
Congrats to Wout and Sarah on their new baby boy!! So happy for them.
Wout is an incredible athlete and incredible human being! Huge kudos on helping your team to another Tour win and sincerest congratulations on the birth of your second son!
Thank you for everything. Good luck with the baby!!!!
"i dont get tho why did he come to the tour even though he knew he was going to leave. just wanted his stage win and doesnt care about the team, selfish."
"Wout is my favorite rider by far, and his dedication to his wife just solidified his place on my personal podium."
"With Jonas almost certain of becoming the champion of 2023 Tour de France, I feel like Wout has done his job well, although it is a pitty that he didn't get a stage win before he left the team for something more important."
A real man. A real hero.
Congratulations with The beautiful child❤❤❤🇩🇰.now we in Denmark Hope you win The world Championship ❤
"No no no noooooo, first you wait to turn 90 years old and then retire,😓😥😭😓😟😥😢☹️🙁😕😰😨😧😦😯😓😟😢☹️😞😕😣"
I love you wout
❤ love that it was not a dilemma!!
Hope she has a smooth delivery. Looking forward to hearing a good news for WVA
"Wout is easily the most impressive rider in this year’s TdF. There is nothing he can’t do, and proved it through every stage. Congrats on the upcoming birth of your child🎉 Wout."
Congratulations.
100% the right decision
Counting the time to see some photos of a mini-Wout riding a tiny bike.
"One of the best riders of his generation and a family man.  Well done, Wout."
What a stud of a man.
A true man! Mad respect for that young man
"Great respect to Wout, and his team for supporting his family. Chapeau!"
"Best to Wout!
A good and accomplished father is too rare - take it from a child of abuse and abandonment.
Wout has done some of the most outstanding team work, and i'm jealous that i will not be his child. It would be difficult for him to pick me up, though he would not have to teach me how to ride a bicycle."
"Wout and Sepp are the reason I watch whenever cycling is available.  They do their job every day, no whining. Maybe not GC (yet) but members of a powerhouse team of great cyclists."
life stage win
"Well done Wout, suit up catch your baby.I cought all but one of mine. Pretty awesome being the first to hold your child."
"Respect to the man for putting his family first. I will never forget the insane work he did on stage 6 of the tour. To me he looked like a demigod on a bicycle. Good man, you deserve all the luck in the world!"
Great sports person and also a great husband and father. Modern hero. WVA!
The guy is awesome! Best wishes for a successful birth!
Am I the only one who thinks he should ‘ve planned getting another kid better? Like tdf is only 3 weeks in one year.
"Family first, even ahead of the Tour. Good luck, the hard work is just about to begin!!!"
Best Wishes Wout!! Thankyou for all the great examples of power and conviction! We love watching you!🚴🏻💨💨💨
"Congratulations young man, to you and your new family. 🤙🏻"
We love Wout Van Aert
family first- right move. Good luck to your family.
"There will be more opportunities for a win in the future, there will be no second chances to witness your  2nd son being born. Wise and logical choice. Congratulations, i wish for a good health for  yourself, Sarah and the Newborn. Enjoy the moment Champ. 🤘❤️"
How nice :) is he speaking dutch or Flemish?
"My 2 favs ,Julian & Wout,real racers always lookin to go"
good luck mate
Good luck Wout. Great decision and great team.
"I mean, he did his job. If they lose with their current lead that is not his fault. He's been an ideal teammate and husband. What a great July he's having."
"These are the acceptable decisions for riders in the modern age of professional cycling. In previous eras, it would not have been acceptable to leave the team during a grand tour for this reason or the like."
Thank you for everything you have done this tdf <3
I’ll still hold on to the idea that he only made the decision once he knew Jonas had yellow nailed on.
It definitely doesn't hurt that Jonas is basically guaranteed the win now either
Good Luck! Hope to see you on the bike soon. Family first.
I had no idea that he was married let alone that his wife was pregnant. Good choice to leave the tour it's more important for him to be home.
"With 7 min lead, yes go home"
Wishing you all the best for you and your family
A total stud! Thanks for the show at the tour and congratulations on the addition to the family!
"Team will mange for sure,  Jonas are in good spot and in best form at the moment."
Put his all in supporting his team this Tour de France and now gets to go home to support his wife and family. Congrats and happy home coming to your wife and kid :)
"Such a great man! There will be other races, but baby's birth only happens once. Good vibes to the family for the birth."
Today's stage was well-suited for him to win. Congratulations to him
"i root for pogacar but if whenever you race i cheer for you. i hope one day you will wear the green, polkadot and yellow jersey"
You already is an excellet father Mr Van Aert and a good husband too.
Wout is my favorite pro by a long shot so I'm sad to hear this.   But I'm also happy for him and his family.  Enjoy your time off!
All the best WVA!!! You were a savage this Tour!!
"Wout, the steamroller ! Your fans understand baby Wout & mom needs you more! 🎉"
Wout! Wout! Wout! What a guy :D
"The TDF is done barring any mishaps, you have done your part for the team even sacrificing personal glory.Focus now on the trophy that will give you enormous joy.
Congrats Wout."
His job is done.  Jonas Vingegaard already won the tour in a bag.
"salamat par.. kakaiba ang lakas mo.. legend ,, a begian champ... TJV is where your home,,, comeback stronger,,, with roglic next year"
"WVA has been IMMENSE in supporting his team and now his team and fans support him and his family in their priorities - NOTHING is more important than family. The team was prepared for this eventuality and WVA gave EVERYTHING in this tour. He is more than just a great cyclist! 

It was a pity he didn't achieve a stage win, but his contribution to the team, and especially to Jonas Vindegaard, has been a joy to watch.

I've never subscribed to a cycling team channel before, and I only started following the TdF in 2017. However, the performance of team Jumbo-Visma and all the heroes in the saddle, especially Wout Van Aert in his decision today, mean I subscribe to this channel. It will join my only other cycling channel subscription, which is with Lanterne Rouge, of course!"
Wout is one of my favorite riders. Super happy for him and his family!
"Good luck for a wonderful family, mate.

M 🦘🏏😎"
Bro is a domestique on and off the bike!
"You will be missed, but being there for your wife and child is where you should be. The Tour will be there next year."
All the best to your Familie Wout ❤❤❤ Family ALWAYS comes first!
Family first! Hope it all goes well!
Definitely right choice!! Nothing better then supporting your Wife when she needed Congrats!! Enjoy the moment!!
"Translation: We know we got this.  The guy still rode like a beast, even with his wife and new baby on his mind. Congratulations, Wout!!"
Sh#t man who needs it. Go and have a kip. It's not like you.haven't earned it
"Sounds awfully selfish.  He took a spot from someone, oh well. If he wasnt as good as he was people would be saying the same but again, oh well."
"Thumbs up when somebody leaves the tour? Heck yeah, good on ya!"
he is the real winner of the tour! congratulations🎉
Wout has helped deliver Jonas a win and now must help his wife deliver.    😊
Wish u n ur partner all the very best. Cheers ✌🏻
"Wout has been the MVP last year, and this year is no exception. I could say honestly that he could leave the Tour being proud of himself, because his contributions for making Jonas winner-elect have been essential. It's unfortunate he got no wins, but it's not because he's been low-profile on this Tour! Au contraire!
Have some great time with the family, and the newborn! Thank you Wout!
Cheers from Québec Canada."
you deserve to be there for the birth of your child! there will be another Tour next year
"Congratulations to Woot!
So happy he could be a part of this tour, he spent so much time on the front fighting for his team, what a ridder he is...
Now is the time for him to be with his family.
Definitely the Best of the normal people 🎉"
"We the flemmish people are extreme proud ! We love him so much because he always stay sober . And he gives us so much joy , I wish our gouverment could do the same !"
Good job Wout. Best of luck with the addition to the family.
"Congrats, Daddy! 

You were a superstar this year and mightily helped your man secure the Yellow. Next year, multiple stages on the Tour!"
Congratulations on the new Van Aert! ♥
Imagine if Jonas loses the tour now because Wout decided to leave.
Good for you Wout. Much respect.
The best of luck! This guy is a legend!
A real man and real bike rider
"Good for wout,and good for the whole team. Much respect"
I was rooting for Wout to win a stage this year but I'm also happy to see him happy to get home to his new baby.  All the best to the mom and the baby!
My main man is still MVP but Wout is undoubtedly a top bloke. Hope everything goes well for you and your wife Wout.
I don’t think Jonas is going to win the TDF without Wout.
"I’m a huge fan of WVA, he’s been a rock on this team!"
"The timing couldn't be more perfect, with Jonas now leading the Tour by a very comfortable margin and only four stages remaining. Wout did his part as an excellent teammate, and now he can do his part as an excellent husband and father."
The job is done! Well done WVA!!! Go wnjoy your time with you fam!
Wout is absolutely the best all-around cyclist on the 🌎
"Best of luck to you and your wife, Wout.  Has been a tremendous successful Tour for TJV."
Good to see him going to help his family. The timing of that choice could tough because perhaps she won't even start labor until after the tour is over (?)
You are a true warrior and I hope all goes well so you get to be a great dad too! You've done the team proud
Congrats on your angel idol wout. Thanks for helping our team LETS GO JUMBO!!!!!
Good luck for the whole family! Hopefully Wout will show up with his kid on the podium in Paris next year .
He's done a hell of a lot for the team in this year's tour. Mad respect to this athlete.
"Another great victory for Wout, Team Jumbo-Visma and Cycling !!!"
All the best!
big big rider and deep respect. best to him and family.
"Best of luck! It's a shame to see him leave early, but it's his life and his priorities. He'll come back stronger next year."
Family comes first plus Jonas has a seven minute lead and the team can spare Wout. I hope Wout would have been allowed to be with his wife even if the time difference between Jonas and Tadej were still 10 seconds.
Wout van Aert left the Tour de France to be with his wife Sarah who will soon give birth to their second child. A great man inside a gesture of love for one's neighbor. Good boy -
"Wout, TY from Denmark.. Amazing ride for Jonas this year... <3"
Always family Come first good Season and good tt
"En french we say 'ça sent le roussi'

Something is after Jonas and it doesn't have wheels."
Good man! The ability and integrity of him is proven both as a cyclist and a father to be.
So much important than sport !!!  Thanks Wout !
Priorities straight!!
Congratulations and Good Luck to Wout and Sarah. 😊
You have done your job for this Tour.  The team is strong.  Congratulations to Jumbo Visma and good luck to you and Sarah welcoming your child together.  Bravo!!!
RESPECT!!
kinda cool that the team allows this
"The best kind of decision and love the depth to which Wout is a family man, which will last forever. All the best to Wout and Sarah!"
He's my favourite but there are more important things in life than TdF. Best wishes!
"Wout is a beast and I love his perspective....""not a dilemma"".  Good on your for being home and hats off on a solid TDF for Jumbo."
"Respect, but no recovery time haha! Congratulations! You were a weapon in the tour."
"The Danish reporter heared Jonas telling Wout ""Good Luck"", but he brushed it of during the interview in ""The Evening Tour"". Now that Wout has made it public, we can all wish them Good Luck :)"
Super wout congratulations and    Thanks for your incredible help see you soon
Good decision!
"Wout you’re a champ! You got your priorities right, at the end of the day it’s just cycling."
I thought I would see the rest of the team specially WVA to get a stage win because of the lead they have on Pogi and looking forward on Paris and thinking if he's going to race with Philipsen and other sprinter. That could have been a perfect scenario before going home but still happy for him.
Great job Wout and Best of luck with The New baby❤🇩🇰
Absolute class act and a true legend💪🏼🙌🏻💪🏼🙌🏻
"i got into cycling and started seeing it on tv because of you Wout, and watching this video just confirms everything i think about you, you are a champion in sport as well as in life, congratulations on your imminent birth and best wishes for the world championships! Greetings from Rome Italy."
All the best for Wout and his family!
"A great rider and a great person. You always go for the win, and sure you went for the win on this one. I wish you and your family all the best!"
Champ!
"Congrats Wout and Mrs Wout! Fantastic rider, fantastic guy - can't wait to watch what you achieve in the future Wout! All the love from the UK <3"
"Proficiat Wout
Dank u!"
"Gr8 Shame that Wout won't be on the Podium with the rest of the Lads 4 best winning team . 
Awesome Rider . 👌 
However the Birth of a Child & his Wife come 1st . 
Gr8 👍 that he was able 2 Ride 3/4 of the TdeF ."
"All the best to you and your wife. 
And I love the TJV shirts with the pink, yellow and red stripes on them."
"My respect for WVA went up tremendously after hearing this. Chapeau Wout, the team, and especially Sarah!"
So he chicken out of tdf?
Now we know why he always rides 65kmh!!  He wanted to be home fast 😅
Good guy and congratulations in advance!
"Dear Wout, you are a great cyclist and everyone could witness your talent and the hard work! Right now your place is at your wife's side, and you and your team made the right decicion. Respect! Wish you, your wife and your unborn child all the best!"
All the luck to Wout and lot of health to the little one
TIL the Belgian word for comfortable is comfortable
"What a true sportsman he is, family always comes first <3 so much talent, heart and bravery on the jumbo visma team. Well done Wout Van Aert, looking forward to seeing you with the new family member."
You're the man 🎉
"Congrats Wout...You are a Good  biker,you are a Good man and you are a Good father..."
Congrats Wout and Sarah! 🎉
"Don't know if Wout reads those comments, but if he does: i've got the greatest respect for you as a sportsman, husband and person. You are the person that inspired my son to go from football to cycling, who helped me to convince him what a beautiful sport it is and to enjoy it. I personally admire you for managing the struggle between you being an exceptional rider yourself and focusing on the teams and Jonas goals so well.

I wish the best to you and your wife for the next days (and years) to come.

Tonight my 8y old son will be dressed in his brand new Jumbo-Visma kit for the first time and take a ride with me and I'm sure he'll wear it with pride and joy and think about his new cycling-heroes Wout & Jonas

And even though I didn't mention them- the same goes for the whole team JV❤ I really enjoy watching you work together so brilliantly."
"Woud, this is the moment, I became a fan of you.
Yesterday you got my appreciation, from today on you get my respect and a place in my heart.
Great Guy"
He will be a good dad. He's got his head in the right place. Congratulations!
ohhhhhh pity😅expected his show till champs elysee.. but cheers! good news for the family🥳 and THX for everything given for the whole team so far!
so sad wout is leaving the tour without a stage win 🥺
All the best for your family and the baby. Thank you for being a cycling monster and idol. See you next year even stronger champ.
"An honourable man, best wishes to Wout and his wife and son for the birth of his daughter."
I was told labour was imminent every day for 2 weeks! Just saying.  They seem to be taking it for granted they’ll win so can dispense with Wout’s services.  But it’s not over til the fat lady sings etc.  I’m just bummed as have a huge crush on Wout.
Legend Wout I enjoy watching you race. Congratulations to you and your wife on the new arrival 💞
Family always comes first.
"Who is left to challenge Jasper now? Only Pederson, this means it is entirely possible he could win 6 stages. Wouldn't that be a spectacle?"
"they won the tour, now he can go home in peace, enjoy the little one"
Congratulations Wout! You really have given your all for the team during this tour.
The guy is a beast and an absolute legend. Vino has it. Get home to mama! Well done Wout and well done Jumbo.
"What an athlete! All the best for you, your wife and your growing family"
"I´m a bit sad, that he´s leaving early, but he´s amazing husband and father who puts family first. I´m so happy for him and his family. See you next year, @woutvanaert !"
Best wishes for you and your family ... now you'll really know what love is ;)
"Family first. There would be other races, there would be other wins. Wout is one of the greatest cyclists the sport has ever seen."
"Such a superstar! Massive machine, team player & seems to be just a great guy. Happy for him."
Congrats Wout!!!
"He Gave everything for the team, He already won this year. Congrats!"
"We will miss you, have good time home, and see you next year champ ! ✌️👍"
Class act! 👏👏👏 The tour won't be the same without Wout but go be a dad!
"Sad to see him go! I really had hoped he would have won a stage he is an amazing rider!
Go luck to you and your family and congratulations in advance!
A true champion 👍"
"My estimation of the team has gone up massively.. it seems many companies want to bleed their staff dry and give themselves 100% to work, neglecting family"
best wishes to Wout and his Wife. Great job on the Tour this year sir. We hope to see you racing again soon. All the best from the U.K!!!
"Good guy , family first"
"He's like a riding cycling ad, can make any stage interesting. Wish the best for his beautiful family and the best for the Worlds!"
Great Tour! Great decision! All the best! :-)
Legend - father - teammate - this dude has to be next UCI president !
What a hero
"Massive respect to you, Sir 🥂"
Well done Wout! Absolutely the right decision. Family always comes first! 💪
"<3 you would have deserved the most agressive rider award again but I think being with your wife while your kid is born is worth that 100%.
Congrats and good luck."
"What a fantastic man. Wout, I hope that in the chaotic world around you, you'll always manage to have the right priorities! This short video shows how much you love your wife and cherish your family. I hope everything goes well - all the best to you four <3"
"October 25th 2023
jumbo sport directors visit all wifes and girfriends with anticonception pill to prevent any birth in the tour 2024 
XDXDXDXDXD"
"being a huge MVDP Fan, I highly admire and respect this guy!   an absolute machine & teamplayer...  and so humble!  wish him & his family well for the new baby!"
He quit? Revoke his stage win! You have to finish the tour in order to receive a stage win!!!
"Monkey man, bye"
It's been a pleasure to watch you ride Wout - stage wins aren't everything - I like your comment about the good feeling on the bike. Good luck to you and your family!
"Well Wout, you're a real man, a decent man, a proud family man & one hell of a cyclist.
You deserved a stage win in the tour, it just wasn't to be this time, but know this 'you've lots more wins in your legs to come. I'll be at the worlds in Scotland cheering you on & you winning would put a huge smile on my face.

For now, being with Sarah is your job & the birth of your newborn is a WIN WIN all the way.

You're an incredible rider & equally so, an obviously great human being.

All the very best & congratulations on the imminent birth."
The class definition.
"You're a legend, Wout! Go be at home with your family and enjoy what you have achieved in this Tour up until now, which isn't little."
Good for you Wout being a dad is the best 👌
CONGRATULATIONS WOUT on your promotion to Fatherhood!!!! You did another amazing job in TDF2023 and is the right time to be back with your wife. That moment is precious  . . .
👍Respect... you made a great TDF as Usual... good rest with your Wife
"The race is over, so he’s not needed any longer and may therefore take leave now"
Best wishes to Sarah and Wout.
Hope he gets a paternity test before celebrating.
"Good man, congratulations to you and your family, and also TJV's TDF 2023 Edition."
"I am a bit sad, that my favorite rider did not win a stage haha - but of course I wish him all the best! :)"
Everything will go fine and many more tours will come! Congratulations for Wout and his family! 🎉❤
Thank you Wout! Also congrats!
"Best of luck for you, your wife and the baby. You are the shinning star that is getting people into cycling. Cheers"
"Hope for the best for your child and your wife. Everything is going to be alright. You are Wout, the husband, the father before Wout the great rider. Respect your decision and will support."
Best wishes for second baby! Nothing will be precious than yours!! Good luck!!
Family First Wout. Big respect
Congrats man on the result in the tour! You kind of have two families but the one closest to heart will always mean the most. Family first! Wishes your wife and you a safe delivery.
"Unfortunate that he doesn't have the chance to compete for a stage win, but he and Sarah will be winning when she brings the new kid into the world. Congrats Wout"
"His job is done at this year TDF, helping Jonas to secure the yellow jersey. No way pogacar gonna fight back those 7 minutes, unless he put a 200 watt hidden motor in this bike 🤣"
Yes! This is part of what makes him a CHAMPION.
"Helping the team for the win in the tour and beeing with your wife when she's expecting your child in the same month.
Mad respect for Wout an absolute legend!"
Wout looks happy. Happier than a stage win. Good for him and the team for their support. Go Wout!
"Legend. Best of luck with worlds, even though I’m not Belgian. You would be a deserved winner."
I an so happy for wout that the team allows him to be there for his family when they need him the most
Solid choice. You'll win enough jerseys and stages in the coming years. Best of Luck to you
Wout is a nice guy. He sacrificed Tour to be with his wife. I hope that Wout will win the World Championship... ❤️❤️❤️🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪
"Now that Vingo already secured the Yellow jersey, it's really the best time for Wout to focus on his pregnant wife."
Good luck WvA
